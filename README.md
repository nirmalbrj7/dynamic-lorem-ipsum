## Features

- Generate Lorem Ipsum content in various formats:
  - Sentences
  - Paragraphs
  - Text (multiple paragraphs)
  - Specified byte length
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Modular design for easy extension
- CLI for convenient usage from the terminal

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```sh
npm install dynamic-lorem-ipsum
```

## Usage

### Programmatic API

You can use the package in any JavaScript environment. Below are examples of how to use the package in Node.js and React.

#### In Node.js

```javascript
const {
  generateSentence,
  generateParagraph,
  generateText,
  generateBytes,
  generateList
} = require('dynamic-lorem-ipsum');

console.log(generateSentence(10)); // Generates a sentence with 10 words
console.log(generateParagraph(5)); // Generates a paragraph with 5 sentences
console.log(generateText(3));      // Generates text with 3 paragraphs
console.log(generateBytes(100));   // Generates text with 100 bytes length
console.log(generateList(5, true)); // Generates an ordered list with 5 items
```

#### In React

First, install the package in your React project:

```sh
npm install dynamic-lorem-ipsum
```

Then, use it in your React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {
  generateSentence,
  generateParagraph,
  generateText,
  generateBytes,
  generateList
} from 'dynamic-lorem-ipsum';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dynamic Lorem Ipsum Generator</h1>
      <p>{generateSentence(10)}</p>
      <p>{generateParagraph(5)}</p>
      <pre>{generateText(3)}</pre>
      <p>{generateBytes(100)}</p>
      <pre>{generateList(5, true)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Command-Line Interface

To use the CLI, you can install the package globally:

```sh
npm install -g dynamic-lorem-ipsum
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run the CLI without installing it globally:

```sh
npx dynamic-lorem-ipsum <command> [options]
```

  ```sh
  dynamic-lorem paragraph --sentences 5
  ```

- Generate text with a specified number of paragraphs:
  ```sh
  dynamic-lorem text --paragraphs 3
  ```

- Generate text with a specified byte length:
  ```sh
  dynamic-lorem bytes --bytes 100

test('generateSentence generates a sentence with specified word count', () => {
    const wordCount = 5;
    const sentence = generateSentence(wordCount);
    expect(sentence.split(' ').length).toBe(wordCount);
    expect(sentence.endsWith('.')).toBe(true);
    expect(sentence[0]).toBe(sentence[0].toUpperCase());
});
```
